<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [x] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - [x] Any input field is empty
  - [x] The email address is not formatted correctly

  </ul>

  <img alt="JavaScript" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-yellow?style=flat-square&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=white" />
  
  <img alt="SASS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-SASS-bf4080?style=flat-square&logo=sass&logoColor=white" />
</p>
<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    I learnt how to error handle without requiring JavaScript; although, I think JavaScript would have been a better solution.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I am happy with the results of this project. I would only change one thing; I would like it if my Inputs errored after being touched by the user,
    the current state throws off the overall design.
